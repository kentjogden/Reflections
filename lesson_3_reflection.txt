When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You would want to use a remote when you want to collaborate with others.
    Remotes will allow multiple people to access the file.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want to start diverging from what is on github or you may not
    want to have everything that the other collaborator has put up. You also
    may only want certain branches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is how you can clone a repository and still have it link to the
    original on github. A fork allows you to control a repository that was
    originally from someone else while still linking it to the original.
    a clone is a copy of the repository but the updates you make to that
    repository will still occur on the original repository that you cloned.
    a branch is a part of the repository and is just another path of commits.
