 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


    When you initialize a repository you are setting up the git filing system
    that allows git to handle your commits and branches etc... You need to do
    this because you only want git repositories in folders that contain projects
    that you would like to track using git version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?


    This allows you to think through how you are going to logically separate
    commits so that you can make simpler changes.
    The staging area is different than the working directory and the repository
    because it is taking files from the working directory and setting them up
    to be committed to the repository.
